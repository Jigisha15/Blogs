This is a Blogging Website that I am making with the help of Django a Python framework. This website has a basic and user-friendly UI and CRUD operating features.

This website can display blog-posts and the viewers can view the blogs and search them without creating an account. But to be able to write blogs the user needs to be a registered user.

The files are properly configured but if in-case you find that the CSS file is not functioning properly then do try running the app at a different port using the command -> python manage.py runserver 'port-number'

The superuser id password is provided in the settings file to access the Django-Admin-Panel ie the database in other words.
